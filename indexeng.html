                <h2>Why are we developing a game?</h2>
                <p id="texteIntro">We are four students at EPITA Toulouse, 
                    and this school requires the realization of a group project over a period of 6 months, 
                    with a presentation at the end of the year. As we got along well, we decided to form the ANAT group, 
                    and to develop our own video game. This is how "Un réveil mouvementé" was born, 
                    and we hope with all our heart that our project will give you a good time. </p>

                <h2>Plot of the adventure</h2>
                <p id="texteJeu">Our game features 2D puzzle, action and adventure gameplay. 
                    When the game starts, you wake up on a beach, without knowing where you are. 
                    Soon, you will have to collect information and solve puzzles to progress. 
                    After learning about the place where you have landed, 
                    you will be confronted with different monsters and traps that await you in the dark...</p>

                        I chose this branch because the potential of creation and adaptation is at the heart of the discipline, 
                        and this is what attracts me to computer science. I was chosen as group leader for this project. 
                        Being passionate about music in my free time, it is quite natural that I also proposed myself as 
                        sound designer and composer of the game's music. I am also in charge of the creation of the character inventory, 
                        the interactions with the game objects and the website you are currently using.</p>

                        I have a brother who studied computer science and made me want to get into it. 
                        In this project, I'm in charge of the creation of the whole map and the 
                        transitions between the different scenes, as well as the organization of the game.</p>

                        I'm interested in computer science since I was a kid, 
                        especially in development and cybersecurity. In this project, 
                        I'm in charge of creating the characters, their animations, the multiplayer mode and the different menus.</p>

                        That's what motivated me to do these studies. In this project, 
                        I'm in charge of the creation of the artificial intelligence of the enemies of the game, 
                        as well as the one of the end boss. I will also have to manage the concept of damage in collaboration with Nicolas.</p>
